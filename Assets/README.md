# 05-weatherapp

In this assignment, we had to create a weathr app that displayed the current weather and the forecast for the next five days. I was unable to find a free working 5 day forecast API so I tried to work with the current weather so I could at least have something to submit.

I had a particularly difficult time with this assignment.
